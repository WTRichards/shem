# Scanning Helium Microscopy Simulation Library

A GPU-accelerated SHeM (Scanning Helium Microscopy) simulation framework.
Example commands for running the framework can be found in example.sh and a default configuration file can be found under shem/default_config.py
Reading the comments in default_config.py is *strongly* recommended
